    "# Search\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework, you'll implement a basic search engine by defining your own Python classes. A **search engine** is an algorithm that takes a query and retrieves the most relevant documents for that query. In order to identify the most relevant documents, our search engine will use **term frequency–inverse document frequency** ([tf–idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf)), an information statistic for determining the relevance of a term to each document from a corpus consisting of many documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **tf–idf statistic** is a product of two values: term frequency and inverse document frequency. **Term frequency** computes the number of times that a term appears in a **document** (such as a single Wikipedia page). If we were to use only the term frequency in determining the relevance of a term to each document, then our search result might not be helpful since most documents contain many common words such as \"the\" or \"a\". In order to downweight these common terms, the **document frequency** computes the number of times that a term appears across the **corpus** of all documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need the `doggos` and `small_wiki` directories to be copied to your work area in the same folder. You do not need to submit these folders but should submit this notebook file after `Run All` and saved."
